953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary
https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.

Can you do this in a single pass?

Example:
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
